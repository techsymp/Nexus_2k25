                    Round 1: The ECE Lockdown (Escape Room – Logic & Circuit Challenges)<br>

Teams must solve a series of technical puzzles to unlock the final checkpoint. This round consists of two interactive phases that test theoretical knowledge, logical reasoning, and problem-solving skills.<br>

Phase 1: Digital Code Cracker (MCQ & Jumbled Words Challenge)<br>

Each team gets a sequence of locked challenges where the key to unlocking the next step lies in solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and jumbled technical terms.<br>

Each correct answer provides a numeric or word-based key to progress.<br>


Topics Covered:<br>

Basic Electronics & Circuit Components<br>

Digital Logic & Boolean Algebra<br>

Communication Systems & Modulation<br>


Example Questions:<br>

Which type of filter allows low frequencies and blocks high frequencies?<br>
(A) High Pass (B) Band Stop (C) Low Pass (D) Band Pass (Correct Answer: C – Low Pass Filter)<br>

Which modulation technique is used in FM radio?<br>
(A) Amplitude Modulation (B) Frequency Modulation (C) Phase Modulation (D) Pulse Code Modulation (Correct Answer: B – Frequency Modulation)<br><br>


Example Jumbled Words:<br>

TEISORSR → Resistor<br>

TRCNREASOM → Transistor<br>

ODMRLTAIOUN → Modulation<br>


Scoring:<br>

Each correct answer unlocks the next challenge.<br>

The first eight teams to complete the phase move forward.<br>

<br>


Phase 2: Circuit Logic Puzzle (Debugging & Logical Sequencing)<br>

Teams receive incomplete or scrambled circuit processes and must arrange them in the correct operational order.<br>

Some steps may contain intentional errors, which teams must identify and correct.<br>


Example Challenge:<br>

(Correct Order for Signal Transmission: Modulation → Transmission → Reception → Demodulation)<br>

(Correct Order for Rectifier Circuit: Transformer → Rectifier → Filter → Regulator)<br>


Scoring:<br>

Correct sequencing: +20 points<br>

Correct debugging of errors: +10 points
<br>

⮞ Top 4 teams advance to Round 2.<br>


<br>
Round 2: Circuit Breakout – Debugging & Problem-Solving<br>

Teams must identify and correct errors in a given faulty circuit.<br>

Phase 1: Debugging Challenge (Error Identification & Correction)<br>

Teams receive a faulty circuit diagram and must identify incorrect components, misplaced connections, or missing elements.<br>

They must explain the mistakes and provide the correct modifications.<br>


Example Errors:<br>

Incorrect Component Value: A 100Ω resistor incorrectly placed instead of 1kΩ.<br>

Missing Component: A pull-down resistor missing in a transistor switch circuit.<br>

Wiring Mistake: Incorrect grounding of an operational amplifier.<br>


Scoring:<br>

Each correctly identified and explained error earns points.<br>

The top two teams proceed to the Final Round.<br>




Round 3: The Ultimate Circuit Puzzle – Unlock the Exit<br>

The final teams must complete a three-layered circuit puzzle to win.<br>

Phase 1: The Final Challenge<br>

1. Component Matching: Identify missing components and justify their roles.<br>


2. Logical Circuit Flow: Arrange circuit blocks in the correct operational sequence.<br>


3. Final Debug & Correction: Solve a circuit with intentional faults and present the corrected version.<br>



⮞ The first team to complete all tasks correctly wins Electro Clash!<br>


Conclusion:<br>

Electro Clash is a fusion of technical knowledge, logic, and hands-on problem-solving in an interactive, cost-effective format. By focusing on physical, engaging challenges, the event ensures an immersive experience that enhances teamwork, quick thinking, and circuit analysis skills in a competitive yet fun setting.
